# Web Scraping with Python using Selenium and  (condomenium listings in Bangkok, Thailand)

This is the second episode of web scraping project and we are still working on condomenium listings in Bangkok, Thailand. You can find my first project [here.](https://github.com/ekapope/Baania-webscraping)

The page we are going to pull data from is called [Hipflat](https://www.hipflat.co.th/). This project will be using Selenium library to run the first get (request) to obtain all condo links, and then extract info elements using BeautifulSoup package.

Please note:

As always, scraping the website is only allowed for personal use.
Given the "sleep" intervals embedded in the code, it gently scrapes the pages so it will take a while to complete the whole operation.
